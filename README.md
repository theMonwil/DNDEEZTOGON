# DNDEEZTOGON
Mod made for the Year of the Gaper Isaac modjam.

Mod's main new feature is a new character, artificer Rava. His main ability is infusing nearby pickups, turning them into homunculi that help him out in combat.
Homunculi however have a very limited lifespan, so haste is required if one wants to get the most value out of each one.
While in a fight, he can also periodically summon all active homunculi towards himself, which can be used to direct them towards enemies. Summoning also creates an extra Homunculus out of thin air, so use it often!

Mod is still unfinished, hence it's currently not published yet.
